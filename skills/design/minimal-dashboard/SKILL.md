# Minimal Dashboard

Design and build **dark, functional, data-dense application interfaces**: admin panels, POS systems, inventory managers, analytics dashboards, back-offices.

The reference implementation is a POS/inventory app ("Cajora POS") with a sidebar, product tables, a checkout screen, a slide-over product detail panel, and a reports page with stat cards and charts. Everything in this skill generalizes from that reference.

This is **not** a marketing skill. There is no hero, no persuasive copy, no scroll animation. The goal is a tool someone uses for eight hours a day: fast to scan, low-glare, predictable, and boring in the right places.

---

## Core Philosophy

> **Color is reserved for meaning. Chrome is monochrome.**

This is the single rule that separates this style from typical "colorful SaaS dashboard" templates:

- Navigation, buttons, cards, borders, inputs — all neutral near-black / off-white grayscale. No brand-colored sidebar, no colored primary buttons, no gradient anything.
- Color appears **only** to communicate status or data: green = success/positive, red = danger/negative/zero, amber = warning/low, blue (or a categorical chart palette) = data series in charts.
- If you're tempted to add a brand accent color to a button, a border, or an icon just to make it "pop" — don't. That signal is spent on things that actually need attention (stock about to run out, a sale that went down, a destructive action).

Secondary principles:

- **Density over whitespace.** Rows are compact, tables carry a lot of information per screen. This is the opposite of a landing page — the user needs to scan 20 rows at once, not admire 3.
- **Borders and surface-contrast over shadows.** Elevation is done with a slightly lighter surface color and a hairline border, not big soft shadows.
- **Numbers align and read fast.** Prices, stock counts, and stats stay right-aligned or in fixed-width contexts, bold where they're the primary value of a row.
- **Every piece of state is legible at a glance**: a stock count, a trend, a payment method, an alert — is instantly readable without hovering or clicking.

## 1. Design Tokens — Source of Truth

See `DESIGN.md` for the full token table. Summary:

```css
/* Base surfaces — neutral, cool, near-black. Never warm/amber, never pure #000. */
--bg: #0a0a0b;              /* page + sidebar background */
--surface: #111113;         /* inputs, table header, sidebar active item */
--surface-elevated: #17171a;/* cards, stat cards, slide-over panel, modals */
--border: rgba(255,255,255,0.08);        /* default hairline */
--border-medium: rgba(255,255,255,0.14); /* dividers that need to read more clearly */

/* Text */
--text: #f5f5f4;             /* primary value, headings */
--text-secondary: #9a9a9f;   /* labels, subtitles, muted rows */
--text-muted: #6b6b70;       /* placeholders, disabled, captions */

/* Semantic — the ONLY color in the system */
--success: #3ecf70;  /* positive trend, in-stock, confirmations */
--danger:  #e5484d;  /* negative trend, zero stock, destructive actions */
--warning: #e0a63e;  /* low stock, needs-attention numbers */
--info:    #4f8ff7;  /* primary chart series, links, focus ring */

/* Chart categorical palette (order matters, reuse in this order) */
--chart-1: #4f8ff7; /* blue */
--chart-2: #3ecf70; /* green */
--chart-3: #b476f0; /* purple */
--chart-4: #e0a63e; /* amber */
--chart-5: #ec6cad; /* pink */
--chart-6: #6b6b70; /* gray — "other/uncategorized" bucket */
```

**Guardrails:**
- `--bg` stays neutral and near-black: luminance below 12%, no warm or cool tint strong enough to read as "themed." This is a tool, not a brand moment.
- `--text` keeps AA contrast (4.5:1) against `--bg` and `--surface-elevated`.
- Never introduce a 7th accent hue "for the brand." If a project truly needs brand identity, it goes on the logo and nowhere else — not on buttons, not on the active nav state, not on borders.
- Semantic colors are fixed across projects. Don't reassign green/red/amber roles per project — users transfer intuition about color meaning between tools.

---

## 2. Typography

Use **Inter** (or a similar neutral geometric sans). Numbers should use tabular/lining figures where possible so columns align.

| Role | Size | Weight | Color |
|---|---|---|---|
| Page title (h1) | 28px | 700 | `--text` |
| Page subtitle | 14px | 400 | `--text-secondary` |
| Sidebar section label | 11px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.08em | 600 | `--text-muted` |
| Nav item | 14px | 500 | `--text-secondary` (active: `--text`) |
| Table header | 12px, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.04em | 600 | `--text-secondary` |
| Table primary cell (product name) | 14px | 600 | `--text` |
| Table secondary line (category) | 12.5px | 400 | `--text-secondary` |
| Stat card label | 12px, uppercase | 600 | `--text-secondary` |
| Stat card number | 30–32px | 700 | `--text` |
| Checkout / total number | 36–40px | 800 | `--text` |
| Body / form labels | 13–14px | 400–500 | `--text-secondary` |
| Button text | 14px (13px for compact/sm) | 500 | context-dependent |
| Caption / meta | 12px | 400 | `--text-muted` |

No huge display type anywhere in this style — the largest number on screen is a total or a KPI, never a marketing headline. No letter-spacing tricks on body text, only on uppercase micro-labels.

---

## 3. Application Shell

### Sidebar
- Fixed width ~232px, `--bg` background (same tone as the page — the separation comes from the content area's own surfaces, not from a colored sidebar).
- Top: small square logo mark + product name (bold, `--text`) with a one-line role/tenant label beneath in `--text-secondary` (e.g. "Administrador").
- Sections grouped under uppercase micro-labels (`PUNTO DE VENTA`, `CATÁLOGO`, `OPERACIONES`, `ADMINISTRACIÓN`) — plain gray caps, no icon, no divider line needed if spacing is generous (~24px above each group).
- Nav item: icon (16–18px, stroke) + label, `padding: 10px 12px`, `border-radius: 8px`. Default state transparent with `--text-secondary`/icon-muted. **Active state**: `--surface` background fill (a neutral gray highlight, never a colored one), text and icon promoted to `--text`.
- Bottom of sidebar, pinned: a theme toggle row ("Modo claro" + icon), then a user row: avatar circle (initial letter, `--surface-elevated` bg, `--text`), name (`--text`, 14px 500) + email (`--text-muted`, 12px), trailing chevron for a menu.

### Page header
- Title (h1) left, subtitle directly beneath.
- Action buttons top-right, ordered secondary → secondary → primary (e.g. "Modo edición", "Importar", "Nuevo"). Primary is always the rightmost/most-solid button.

### Filter row
- Search input (leading icon, `Buscar por…` placeholder) grows to fill remaining space; 1–2 select dropdowns beside it, fixed width, trailing chevron. All inputs share the same `--surface` bg + `--border` outline + 8px radius + 40px height.

---

## 4. Buttons

No button ever uses a colored/gradient fill. Hierarchy is expressed through fill vs. outline, not hue.

```css
/* Primary — solid light fill, dark text. Reserved for the single main action. */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--text);      /* near-white */
  color: var(--bg);
  border: 1px solid var(--text);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 10px 18px;
  font-weight: 500;
}
.btn-primary:disabled {
  background: var(--surface);
  color: var(--text-muted);
  border-color: var(--border);
  cursor: not-allowed;
}

/* Secondary — outline, for everything else (Importar, Modo edición, Exportar) */
.btn-secondary {
  background: transparent;
  color: var(--text);
  border: 1px solid var(--border-medium);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 10px 18px;
}
.btn-secondary:hover { background: rgba(255,255,255,0.04); }

/* Destructive — used only inside danger zones / delete confirmations */
.btn-danger {
  background: var(--danger);
  color: #1a0a0a;
  border: 1px solid var(--danger);
}
```

- A large full-width primary button (e.g. "Cobrar" in checkout) follows the same disabled logic: it looks solid/light once the form is valid, and drops to a flat muted gray with muted text when disabled (e.g. total is C$ 0.00) — the disabled state must be unmistakably inert, not just slightly dimmed.
- A row-level action button inside a table (e.g. "Agregar") is small, icon + label, same secondary style, and switches to a fully muted/disabled look when the row's stock is 0.
- Radius is 8px everywhere except pills (999px, see Badges).

---

## 5. Tables

The table is the primary content type in this style. Get it right.

```css
.table-header th {
  font-size: 12px; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: 0.04em;
  color: var(--text-secondary); font-weight: 600;
  padding: 12px 16px; text-align: left;
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border-medium);
}
.table-row td {
  padding: 14px 16px;
  border-bottom: 1px solid var(--border);
}
.table-row:hover { background: rgba(255,255,255,0.02); }
```

- Primary column (name) stacks two lines: bold `--text` name, then a smaller `--text-secondary` line for category/subtype directly beneath with no extra gap (`line-height: 1.3`).
- Numeric columns (price) are plain `--text`, no bold unless it's the row's key metric.
- A "quantity/stock" column combines a **colored number** + a **neutral pill badge** for the unit (see Badges below): the number's color communicates urgency, the pill is purely informational.
- Never zebra-stripe rows. Separation comes from the 1px `--border` only.
- Pagination sits bottom-right of the table container: text buttons "Anterior" / "Siguiente" (`--text-secondary`, disabled when at an edge) flanking numbered page buttons — inactive pages are `--surface` bg + `--text-secondary`, the active page is `--text` bg + `--bg` text (same treatment as a primary button, small size).

---

## 6. Badges & Status Numbers

Two distinct, non-interchangeable patterns:

**Neutral pill badge** — for a unit, type, or category label with no urgency (e.g. "Botella", "Caja ×12", "Paquete x6"):
```css
.badge {
  display: inline-flex; align-items: center;
  background: var(--surface); color: var(--text-secondary);
  border-radius: 999px; padding: 3px 10px; font-size: 12px;
}
```

**Colored status number** — a bare number (no pill, no background), colored by threshold:
- `--text` (default) — healthy stock, no attention needed.
- `--warning` — at or below a low-stock threshold.
- `--danger` — zero / out of stock.

These two patterns are frequently placed side by side in the same cell (`3  Botella`): the number carries the urgency signal, the pill carries the descriptive metadata. Never color the pill itself.

Trend indicators (stat cards) use a small filled triangle + percentage, inline:
- `▲ 12.4% vs anterior` in `--success`
- `▼ 8.1% vs anterior` in `--danger`
- Muted trailing text ("vs anterior") always in `--text-muted`, never colored.

---

## 7. Cards & Stat Cards

```css
.card {
  background: var(--surface-elevated);
  border: 1px solid var(--border);
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 20px 24px;
}
```

- No shadow by default; if elevation must be stronger (e.g. a dropdown, the slide-over panel), use a soft `0 8px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.35)` — subtle, never glowing, never colored.
- **Stat card**: label (uppercase, `--text-secondary`) on top, large bold number below, trend line beneath that. Three stat cards typically sit in a row at the top of a reports page.
- **Chart card**: a title (plain text, 14–15px semibold, not a bracket-label), the chart itself, and — for line charts — a small footer strip of secondary stats (e.g. TOTAL / MEJOR DÍA / PERIODOS) each as label-over-value pairs, same treatment as a mini stat card.
- Cards never use a colored border for emphasis. If a card must stand out, use `--border-medium` or a slightly brighter `--surface-elevated`, not an accent-colored outline.

---

## 8. Slide-over / Detail Panels

For "view details" or "edit" interactions, prefer a right-side slide-over panel over a centered modal when the underlying list should stay visible.

- Fixed width (~400–430px), `--surface-elevated` background, sits above a scrim.
- Header: title (bold, `--text`) + close (×) icon button, top-right.
- An intro block: the entity's primary name (bold) + secondary identifier (e.g. barcode) in `--text-secondary`, on a slightly recessed `--surface` card.
- Content organized into labeled sections (`DATOS GENERALES`, `INFORMACIÓN COMERCIAL` — uppercase, `--text-secondary`, 11–12px), each a 2-column grid of `label (small, muted) / value (bold, --text)` pairs, separated from the next section by a `--border` divider.
- A section can carry a small trailing action ("Editar" with a pencil icon) — treat as a tertiary text link, `--text-secondary`, no button chrome.
- A muted one-line note can clarify where a field is actually managed if it's read-only here ("Precio, costo y stock se gestionan desde Inventario").
- Primary actions stack at the bottom: an outline button for navigation ("Ir a Inventario →"), a solid `--text`-filled button for the main action ("Cerrar" / "Guardar").
- **Danger zone**: its own card at the very bottom, with a `--danger`-tinted background (`rgba(229,72,77,0.08)`) and a `--danger` border, a bold `--danger` heading ("ZONA DE PELIGRO"), a muted explanatory line, and a destructive button. This is the *only* place a colored border/background on a card is acceptable — because it is, deliberately, the one thing that should not look calm.

---

## 9. Charts

- **Line chart**: single series in `--info` (blue), 2px stroke, small filled dots at data points, dashed horizontal gridlines in `--border`, axis labels in `--text-muted` (11–12px, can be lightly monospaced for numeric axes).
- **Donut chart**: hollow center, segments in the fixed categorical palette (`--chart-1..6`) in a stable order so the same category always gets the same color. Pair with a legend list, not on-chart labels: colored dot + category name (left, `--text-secondary`) + value (right, `--text`, tabular numerals).
- No 3D, no drop shadows on chart elements, no gradient fills inside chart segments.
- Segmented toggle above a table ("Ingresos" / "Cantidad") uses a pill-shaped track (`--surface`, `border-radius: 999px`) with the active option as a `--surface-elevated` or `--text`-on-`--bg` filled pill sliding inside it — same visual language as the pagination active state.

---

## 10. Forms & Inputs (checkout / settings)

- All inputs: `--surface` background, `1px solid var(--border)`, `8px` radius, `40px` height, `--text` value, `--text-muted` placeholder.
- Label sits above the input, `--text-secondary`, 13px, `margin-bottom: 6px`.
- A running total/summary block (e.g. checkout) is a stack of label/value rows (`Subtotal`, `Descuento %`, `— Descuento`) each `--text-secondary` label / `--text` value, right-aligned values, ending in a visually distinct **TOTAL** row: larger bold label + very large bold number, separated from the rows above by a `--border-medium` divider.
- Custom checkbox: a plain square outline (`--border-medium`, 4px radius) that fills with `--text` (or `--info` if you want a functional-but-still-neutral checked state) and a check glyph when active — never a colored checkbox track.
- Empty states (e.g. "Escanea un producto o busca un servicio"): a large muted line-icon (28–32px, `--text-muted`, low opacity) centered, with a single line of `--text-muted` caption beneath. No illustration, no color.

---

## 11. Icons

- SVG line icons only (Lucide/Phosphor, outline weight, 1.5–1.75px stroke), 16–20px depending on context (18px nav, 16px table/inline, 20–24px empty states).
- Icons inherit text color for their context — muted in secondary buttons/labels, `--text` when active/primary, semantic color only when the icon *is* the status (a warning triangle, a success check, a trash icon in a danger zone).
- Never place icons in a colored/gradient container. If an icon needs a container (rare in this dense style), use a `--surface` square with `--border`, matching the feature-card container idea but flat and small.

---

## 12. Motion

Kept minimal — this is a tool, not an experience:
- Hover states: background/opacity transitions only, ~150ms ease.
- Slide-over panel: translate-in from the right, ~200ms ease-out, with a fading scrim.
- Row hover: instant-feeling background tint, no delay.
- No scroll-reveal, no count-up numbers, no marquees, no pulsing buttons, no skeleton shimmer beyond a simple opacity pulse if used at all.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## 13. Spacing

Base unit 4px. Common values: `8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32 / 40`.
- Table cell padding: `14px 16px`.
- Card padding: `20–24px`.
- Section vertical rhythm on a page: `24–32px` between major blocks (header → filters → table), not the 120px+ used on marketing pages — this is a dense, above-the-fold-first layout.

---

## 14. Anti-Slop Checklist

Before considering a dashboard screen done, verify:

- [ ] No brand accent color anywhere except charts/status (buttons, borders, active nav are neutral)
- [ ] No gradients, glow, orbs, or grain texture anywhere
- [ ] Semantic colors used consistently: green=success/positive, red=danger/zero/destructive, amber=warning/low, blue=info/primary chart series
- [ ] Every numeric/status value is colored *only* when its state warrants it — most numbers stay neutral `--text`
- [ ] Table rows are separated by hairlines, not shadows or zebra stripes
- [ ] Primary button is solid light-on-dark, used exactly once per view
- [ ] Disabled buttons/rows are unambiguously inert (flat, muted, no hover)
- [ ] Sidebar active state is a neutral surface highlight, not a colored pill or colored text
- [ ] Danger zone is the only place a colored card border/background appears
- [ ] Pills describe metadata (units, categories); colored bare numbers describe urgency — never mixed up
- [ ] No decorative icons, no icon fonts, no emoji
- [ ] Page still reads fine with all motion disabled
- [ ] Layout stays dense and functional, not padded out like a landing page

---

## 15. Technology

```text
React + Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS variables)
lucide-react for icons
recharts / a lightweight chart lib for line + donut charts
```

Keep the component set small and reused everywhere: one `Table`, one `Card`, one `Badge`, one `Button` (with `variant="primary" | "secondary" | "danger"`), one `SlideOver`. Consistency across screens matters more than any single screen looking clever.

---

## Final Principle

**In a dashboard, color is a signal, not a decoration.** If a designer could point at any colored pixel on screen and you can't say *why* it's that color — what state, what meaning — remove the color. The rest of the interface's quality comes from density, alignment, and restraint, exactly like `dark-luxury`, but applied to a tool people work in all day rather than a page people visit once.

See `DESIGN.md` for the full token reference and component specs.
